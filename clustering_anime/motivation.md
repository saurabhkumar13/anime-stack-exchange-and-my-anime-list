# Motivation

* The motivation behind clustering anime or in general tv-series could be to get groups/categories/playlists which are divided on not only using just a particular feature like genre or type etc but on the combination of every such feature.

* Through clustering we can find clusters of data points which are close to each other with respect to a plethora of features

* A simple example could in the case when you have features related to popularity, genre, ratings. The categories formed could be like popular action anime, underrated popular anime among other possibilities.

* The automation of this process lets us humans try various possibilities of categorizations and select the ones we see best fit.
