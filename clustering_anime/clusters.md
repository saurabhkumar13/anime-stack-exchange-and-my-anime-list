* Anime TV series are filled with anime of these particular group of genre and these occur almost always together as they are targetted towards adolescent males

> 6 - unexceptional anime

* This is the largest cluster in the data but it consists of anime which could not differenciate themselves from the rest.
* The most probable reason behind it could be that the features used to identify them could not capture everything the anime actually had to offer.
* Like we don't any feature in our feature space that is related to art style or music style.
* Also almost all of them have less than 100k members associated with them, with usual genre like Comedy, Action, Shounen which almost every anime has.
